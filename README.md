# ENSF409_EightQueens

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

Design a system to solve the infamous Eight Queens problem. That is, write a program which can place any number of queens, up to a maximum of 8, on a chessboard such that no queen can attack any other queens.

### Project Objectives

The project objectives included:

1. Further understanding of Java and its capabilities.
2. Utilize critical thinking to implement an effective algorithm.

## Technologies

The technologies used include:

1. Java version 13.0.2

## Launch

To launch the project on your machine, first ensure that you hava a compatible Java compiler installed. 

Then ensure that the file EightQueens.java is in the same directory as your working directory - i.e. either below or at the same level in reference to the current working directory. Also, while this is obvious, do not change the name of the source file.

Then to compile and run the program through the terminal,

1. Execute the command "javac [path to EightQueens.java]".
3. Execute the command "java [path to EightQueens]".

To be completely explicit, a set of successful commands to run the program would be:

javac EightQueens.java

java EightQueens

## Things to Note

1. Remember that a chessboard is an 8x8 grid.
2. Also remember that a queen is a chess piece which can attack any piece located in the same row, same column, or in any of the four diagonals.
3. Currently main houses examples of possible system uses. When the program is run as is here, nothing will happen. Either uncomment the code in main or write custom code in main to exercise system functionality.
4. This system supports deep cloning of EightQueens objects.
